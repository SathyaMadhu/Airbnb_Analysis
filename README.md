**Phases** **Involved**:

Data Retrieval : Python scripts were employed to extract data/datasets from the MongoDB ATLAS

Data Processing : Obtained data were processed for necessary cleaning and formatting, to attain the defined structure for further analysis.

Data Transformation : The Processed and structured data were inserted into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval capabilities.

Dashboard Creation : Streamlit and Plotly libraries are used to create an interactive and visually pleasing dashboard. This dashboard presents the data in efficient manner which enable users to explore the insights effectively

Database Integration : The relevant data are fetched from the MySQL database and converted in to pandas dataframe using pandas libraries. Those dataframe were integrated into the streamlit dashboard, ensuring the displayed information is up-to-date and accurate.

Output Includes :

• Visually appealing and interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.

• Vibrant data updates on the dashboard based on user choices.

• Numerous dropdown options for users to select various facts and figures to display.
